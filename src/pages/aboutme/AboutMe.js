          Hi, I'm Mark Robertson – a passionate developer and creative thinker who loves building engaging, user-friendly web experiences. I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks like React and enjoy leveraging tools like Tailwind CSS to bring vibrant designs to life.

          Having worked extensively as a private money manager, I’ve collaborated closely with high-net-worth investors and institutional traders in fast-paced, high-pressure markets. This experience has honed my ability to communicate complex financial and technical concepts, navigate high-stakes decision-making, and build trust with demanding stakeholders.

          Transitioning into software engineering has opened new opportunities where technology, business, and innovation intersect—especially in fintech and trading solutions.
