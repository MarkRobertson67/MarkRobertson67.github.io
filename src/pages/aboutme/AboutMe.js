          Hi, I'm Mark Robertson â€“ a passionate developer and creative thinker who loves building engaging, user-friendly web experiences. I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks like React, and I enjoy leveraging tools like Tailwind CSS to bring vibrant designs to life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest technology trends, contributing to open source projects, or simply enjoying a good book and some fresh air. I believe that creativity and innovation go hand-in-hand, and I'm always excited to tackle new challenges.
